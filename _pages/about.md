I'm an Associate Professor in the School of Mathematics at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). I am currently a Visiting Scholar at the Warwick Business School, University of Warwick, and before that, I completed my PhD in Operations Research at the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences (and a joint PhD in Computer Science from City University of Hong Kong). I received my B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Science and Technology of China. You can find my [publication list](https://dblp.org/pid/180/5696.html) here.
